# Random (De)buffs Mod
Random (De)buffs Mod is a mod that will randomly give all players a random buff or debuff, depending on your luck.
Every 120 seconds the mod will give all players the same (de)buff.
The timing can be configured, as well as if it should only allow one buff, use modded buffs if any is active, use debuffs, use pet buffs, minecart buffs, and use potion and mana sickness.
